# TaRu Hardy controller

*A better solution for controlling Hardy targets.*


### What works:

 - Target selection (address mapping), with possibility to select all/none
 - Basic "one shot" commands with no target response: UP, DOWN, RESET, SET SENSITIVITY, SET HITS TO FALL, LIGHTS ON/OFF, MOTION ON/OFF
 - Quick programming with setup of: hits to fall, target up, target down, start and end program
 - The above commands with both arbitrary selected targets or with all targets (special command for all targets)
 - Script manager! (saving, loading, creating and running of scripts)
 - COM connection establishment and disconnect functionality
 - Multi-level logging system 
 - Fetching of target configuration, shown on the preferences tab as a list
 - Fetching of target HITS
 - Show COM port status with a GREEN/YELLOW/RED light (Connected, Busy writing/reading, Disconnected)

### What does not work:


### Future functionality:
